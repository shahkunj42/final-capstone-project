    <p>When you create an account and submit an inquiry, our system will take your information and request and send it to our servers. Then we will review your inquiry and respond via email within 48 hours. In the email we will ask follow up questions for specifics regarding your custom art work and delivery time table. We allow up to 3 revisions and payment is due when final design is agreed upon, then we will ship out your artwork after payment is recieved via paypal</p>

    <h1>Refund Policy?</h1>
    <p>Because we discuss the design and finalize through conversation in email before payment is agreed upon, there is a no refund policy unless items arrive damaged through shipping</p>
